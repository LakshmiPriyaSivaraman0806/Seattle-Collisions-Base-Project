# Seattle-Collisions-Base-Project
The Seattle Collisions Base Project provides an in-depth analysis of traffic accident patterns in Seattle, identifying high-risk locations, frequent collision types, and influential factors like road conditions and time of occurrence. By leveraging Tableau for interactive data visualization, this project helps uncover critical insights into accident hotspots, the severity of collisions, and contributing factors.

This analysis aims to support urban planners, policymakers, and traffic authorities in making data-driven decisions to enhance road safety, optimize traffic management, and implement targeted interventions. Through a detailed breakdown of collision data, the project provides actionable recommendations to reduce accident rates and improve public safety on Seattle‚Äôs roads.

## üìÇ Project Details  
- **Tool Used:** Tabeau Public  
- **Dataset:** Seatle-based collision data DataSet - The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed records of traffic collisions in Seattle, including location, number of people and vehicles involved, collision type, road conditions, weather, light conditions, and contributing factors.
- **Objective:** The project's purpose is to analyze Seattle‚Äôs traffic collision data to identify high-risk locations, common accident causes, and patterns over time. By leveraging data visualization and geospatial mapping, the study aims to provide insights that can help in improving road safety, optimizing traffic management, and reducing accident rates through data-driven decision-making.

## Descriptive & Diagnostic Analysis Questions:
1) Which locations in Seattle experience the highest number of collisions?
2) What are the most common types of collisions (e.g., left turn, rear-end, pedestrian accidents)?
3) How many people and vehicles are involved in collisions at different locations?
4) Is there a seasonal or time-based pattern in accident occurrences?
5) What external factors (e.g., weather, road conditions, lighting) influence collision rates?
6) Which areas need targeted traffic control measures to improve road safety?
7) Which factor highly influence accidents and in which locations of seatle city?

>üö¶ These insights help in identifying accident hotspots, improving urban traffic planning, and enhancing road safety initiatives

## üí°Insights from the Analysis:
‚úÖ **Collision Hotspots by Location:**
- The **highest number of collisions** occur in **downtown Seattle**, particularly near major intersections and highways.
- Areas with high pedestrian activity report frequent accidents.
- **Interstate highways I-5 and I-90** experience significant vehicle collisions.
- Top 3 High-Collision Locations:
> **Battery St Tunnel NB (Alaskan Wy Vi NB ‚Äì Aurora Ave N)**
> **N Northgate Way (Meridian Ave N ‚Äì Corliss Ave N)**
> **Battery St Tunnel SB (Aurora Ave N ‚Äì Alaskan Wy Vi SB)**

Each of these locations records an average of 19+ collisions.

‚úÖ **Collision Analysis by Type:**
- **Parked cars *(45,574)*, Angle collisions *(32,487)*, and Rear-end crashes *(32,106)*** are the most common types of collisions.
- **Pedestrian-involved accidents** peak in autumn and decline from February onwards.
- **Bicycle collisions** increase from **May**, peaking in summer, and drop from **September**.
- **Rear-end collisions** rise significantly in **October** before declining in **November**.
- **Angle collisions** peak in **March** and gradually decrease thereafter.

‚úÖ **Collisions by Weather Conditions:**
- **Clear or partly cloudy weather** sees the **highest number of accidents**, particularly involving *parked cars, angle collisions, and rear-end crashes*.
- **Rainy and overcast conditions** are the **second most accident-prone** weather types.

‚úÖ **Road & Light Conditions Impact on Collisions:**
- **Dry road** conditions have the **highest accident rates**, followed by **wet road conditions** at a **lower frequency** than DryRoad prone accidents.
- Most accidents occur in **daylight**, followed by **dark conditions with street lights on**.

‚úÖ **Accidents Due to Driving Under the Influence (DUI):**
- **Collision Hotspots:** High accident density is observed in central and southern Seattle, particularly around major intersections and highways.
- **Top DUI-Prone Locations:** *Alaskan Way Viaduct SB, Battery St Tunnel AND 1st Ave*. These areas require stricter law enforcement and DUI prevention measures.
- **Traffic Safety Concerns:** Urban roads with high traffic and nightlife activity see more DUI-related collisions, emphasizing the need for better safety awareness and monitoring.

‚úÖ **Impact on People & Vehicles:**
- The *average number of vehicles per collision* is around **2**, with *occasional multi-vehicle pileups on highways*.
- **Pedestrian-involved accidents** are concentrated in **urban areas** with high foot traffic.
- **Certain locations** report **higher injury and fatality rates**, highlighting the need for enhanced safety measures.

‚úÖ **Seasonal & Time-Based Collision Patterns:**
- Collision rates spike in winter, especially **November and December**, due to poor weather conditions.
- **Rush hours (7 AM - 9 AM & 4 PM - 7 PM)** witness a significant rise in accidents due to heavy traffic.
- **Weekend nights (Friday & Saturday)** report a higher number of alcohol-related crashes.

## üöÄRecomendations for Improving Road Safety in Seattle  

- **Implement targeted traffic control measures** in high-risk areas like *Battery St Tunnel, N Northgate Way, and Alaskan Way Viaduct SB* by increasing patrols, intelligent traffic signals, and speed regulation.  
- **Enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety** with better *signage, lighting, designated bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly crossings*, especially in high-foot-traffic areas.  
- **Introduce weather-based safety interventions**, such as *adaptive speed limits, improved drainage, and road maintenance*, to prevent accidents during *rainy, overcast, and winter months*.  

- **Strengthen DUI enforcement** with *frequent sobriety checkpoints, stricter penalties, and public awareness campaigns*, especially in nightlife zones and on *weekend nights*.  
- **Improve road and lighting infrastructure** by upgrading *streetlights in accident-prone dark areas, fixing potholes, and ensuring clear lane markings* to enhance visibility and driving conditions.  
- **Optimize time-based traffic management** by *deploying additional personnel during rush hours (7-9 AM & 4-7 PM)* and exploring *staggered work shifts or congestion pricing* to reduce peak-time road density.  
- **Utilize real-time traffic analytics and data-driven monitoring** to *predict and prevent accidents*, while also providing *public dashboards and alerts* to keep drivers informed about accident hotspots and road conditions.  

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive look into traffic collision patterns, demonstrating how data-driven insights can drive meaningful improvements in road safety and city planning. By utilizing Tableau‚Äôs visualization tools, we uncovered key trends in accident hotspots, external risk factors, and time-based collision patterns. The analysis emphasized the critical role of environmental conditions, driver behavior, and infrastructure in accident prevention, highlighting the need for targeted safety measures. This journey reinforced the value of data analytics in shaping proactive policies, ensuring safer roads through continuous assessment and strategic interventions. Ultimately, this study serves as a guiding framework for leveraging data to enhance urban mobility and public safety. üöóüí®...
